 Email Role Scoring Logic – Documentation
✅ Current Functionality
The email thread processing code assigns role-based scores (approver or requester) to individuals based on their email content, position in the thread, and keyword matches.

🔹 Key Features in Current Score Calculation
1. Temporal Scoring (Sequence Weight)
Each email's position in the thread (i) relative to the total number of emails is used to adjust scoring.

Earlier emails (usually requests) and later emails (usually approvals) are weighted accordingly.

python
Copy
Edit
weight = (i + 1) / total_emails
2. Keyword-Based Role Assignment
A predefined list of approval and request keywords (with weights) is used.

Email body and subject line are scanned for these keywords.

Scores are added to either the approver or requester role based on the presence of these keywords.

python
Copy
Edit
approval_keywords = {"approved": 100, "go ahead": 80, ...}
request_keywords = {"request": 80, "need approval": 100, ...}
3. Context-Sensitive Adjustment
Keyword scores are dynamically adjusted based on context.

Example:

The word "approval" in early emails is more likely to be a request, so its score is reduced if seen early.

python
Copy
Edit
if kw == "approval" and i < total_emails/2:
    adjusted_weight *= 0.6
4. Explicit Approval Phrases
Phrases like "I approve", "approved by me", etc., are given additional boost, especially in the second half of the email sequence.

5. Pronoun-Based Pattern Matching
Regex patterns like r"\bi (approve|agree|am okay with|support)\b" or r"\bcan you approve\b" are used to infer roles from grammar and phrasing.

6. ULTRA WINNER Bonus
A hard-coded bonus (+200 points) is assigned to the first person using an explicit approval phrase (once per thread).

7. Hard Constraints
The sender of the first email is excluded from being considered an approver.

First sender’s approval score is forcibly set to -999.

🧠 Potential Improvements
#	Area	Description	Suggestion
1	Thread Position Curve	Linear scoring by position is simplistic	Use sigmoid or exponential decay for more nuanced weight
2	Semantic Understanding	Keywords alone miss paraphrased intents	Use sentence embeddings to compare intent to prototypical phrases
3	Subject Line Scoring	Currently only minor use	Boost score if subject line includes strong request/approval phrases
4	Role Consistency	One-off matches treated equally	Add consistency bonus for repeated similar actions by a person
5	Reply Context	Only sender-based	Track who replies to whom and infer causal approval/response
6	Quoted Text Handling	Repeated text is scored multiple times	Strip quoted content to avoid double counting
7	Grammar Parsing	Regex is simplistic	Use NLP (e.g., dependency parsing) to extract true subject-verb-intent roles
8	Weighted Confidence Output	Binary output (yes/no)	Provide 0–1 confidence scores based on match strength
9	Diminishing Returns	Repeated keyword use inflates score	Apply weight decay for repeated identical matches
10	Contradiction Detection	No handling of negation	Avoid misclassification of “I can’t approve” or “not approved”

🏁 Conclusion
The current implementation is functionally solid and rule-based, with clear, traceable logic using:

Position weighting

Keyword frequency

Explicit phrase matching

One-time bonuses

To scale this further or apply in more ambiguous, large-scale corporate email contexts, we can enhance the system with:

NLP-based semantic understanding,

Improved thread interaction tracking,

And probabilistic confidence scoring.
