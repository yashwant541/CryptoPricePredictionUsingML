Overview
This script processes email chains to identify key participants (requesters and approvers) based on linguistic patterns and contextual analysis. It's particularly focused on approval workflows in email communications.

Key Components
1. Dependencies
Uses regex (re), CSV handling, system operations

Leverages NLP tools (NLTK for tokenization/POS tagging)

Uses fuzzy string matching (fuzzywuzzy) for approximate keyword matching

Handles datetime parsing

2. Core Functionality
Email Parsing:
Splits email chains into individual messages using split_emails()

Extracts headers (From, To, Subject, etc.) with extract_field()

Parses dates into structured format with parse_date_time()

Separates email bodies from headers with extract_body()

Role Identification:
Uses weighted keyword lists (APPROVER_KEYWORDS, REQUESTER_KEYWORDS)

Implements pronoun pattern matching (PRONOUN_PATTERNS)

Scores participants based on multiple factors:

Keyword presence (50%)

Temporal position in thread (20%)

Explicit approval statements

Special rules (first sender can't be approver)

Analysis Features:
Identifies the most likely requester and approver

Provides detailed scoring breakdowns

Handles fuzzy matching for partial keyword matches

Cleans participant names by removing email addresses

3. Output Generation
Saves parsed emails to CSV (parsed_emails.csv)

Generates detailed summary text file (summary_output.txt)

Creates user role mapping CSV (Email_Users.csv)

4. Special Rules
First email sender is automatically disqualified from being approver

Gives bonus points for first explicit approval in thread

Uses fallback logic if no clear approver is found

Adjusts weights based on email position in thread

Usage
Run the script with an input text file containing email chain:
python email_parse.py input_email.txt

Strengths
Comprehensive keyword matching (exact + fuzzy)

Multi-factor scoring system

Detailed output for analysis

Handles messy email formatting

Clear rules for edge cases

Potential Improvements
Could add more sophisticated NLP analysis

Might benefit from machine learning approach

Could handle more email formats

Might add threading analysis

This script provides a robust framework for analyzing approval workflows in email communications, with particular attention to identifying the key decision-makers in the process.
