# Full code available in this repository
Project Highlights:
Data Collection:

Historical ADA price data was fetched using Yahoo Finance API.
Data Preparation:

The data was preprocessed and scaled using MinMaxScaler.
LSTM Neural Network:

A sequential model with LSTM layers was constructed for prediction.
Model Training:

The model was trained on historical data to learn patterns.
Testing and Visualization:

The trained model was tested on recent data, and the results were visualized using matplotlib.
GitHub Repository:

Results:
The predictions were compared against actual ADA prices, and the model demonstrated impressive accuracy. The visual representation of the actual vs. predicted prices is showcased in the included matplotlib plot.


Next Steps:
Fine-tune the model for even better accuracy.
Explore additional features for enhanced predictions.
Encourage collaboration and contributions from the open-source community.
Conclusion:
Predicting cryptocurrency prices involves intricate challenges, and utilizing LSTM neural networks showcases the potential for accurate forecasting. The complete code, along with the dataset, can be found in the GitHub repository. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the code for your projects.
