Key Financial Ratios & Formulas
Loss Ratio = Incurred Losses / Earned Premiums

Expense Ratio = Underwriting Expenses / Earned Premiums

Combined Ratio = Loss Ratio + Expense Ratio

If < 100% → Underwriting profit

If > 100% → Underwriting loss

Retention Ratio = Renewed Policies / Total Renewable Policies

LAE Ratio = Loss Adjustment Expenses / Incurred Losses

Operating Ratio = Combined Ratio - Investment Income Ratio

Reserve Calculations
Incurred Losses = Paid Losses + Case Reserves + IBNR

Loss Development Factor (LDF) = Ultimate Loss / Reported Loss to Date

Earned Premium = Written Premium × (Days Passed / Policy Term)

Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR) = Written Premium - Earned Premium

Underwriting Metrics
Hit Ratio = Number of Policies Written / Number of Quotes Issued

Average Premium = Total Premium / Number of Policies

Claims Metrics
Claims Frequency = Number of Claims / Number of Policies in Force

Claims Severity = Total Incurred Losses / Number of Claims
